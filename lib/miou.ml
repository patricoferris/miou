  (* This effect is a special effect that can only exist internally in our

     for more details, see the [State] module and the [Cont] step. This effect
     allows us to implement cancellation asynchronously. That is to say that it
     is a task like all the others which will be executed concurrently with the
     others - this saves us above all a mechanism of synchronization on what the
     cancellation implies.

     Thus, on the suspension point where the [cancel] was done, the latter will
     be released when the task and its children have been successfully
     completed/cancelled. However, other tasks (if they exist) will be able to
     be executed concurrently. This allows us to reaffirm the availability to
     perform all our tasks regardless of a cancellation. *)
  let await_cancellation_of prms ~and_return =
    State.Cont (Await_cancellation_of (prms, and_return))

  (* A subtlety prevails here. Normally only the domain in charge of the task
     can modify the promise. But in this case, it is the parent (having launched
     the task) that modifies the promise (note that the task can run into [dom1]
     and the parent runs into [dom0] due to a [Miou.call]). In reality, in a
     [Resolved]/[Failed] state, the task has ended and will no longer have to
     change its state. In this situation, the only one who can interact with the
     promise (and its state) therefore remains the parent who can "consume"
     (await) or cancel the task.

     In other words, if the parent observes that the promise is
     [Resolved]/[Failed], it can safely obtain exclusive ownership of it and
     change its state.

     Attention, the check about the children of a task is done in the [handle]
     function. The [Resolved]/[Failed] state only appears if all children of the
     promise have completed successfully. The same is true in the case of an
     exception where the domain will modify the state only if all the children
     have been canceled. For more information, see the [handle] function. *)

  (* NOTE(dinosaure): [invariant] (used by [handle]) makes it possible to check
     the invariants in the case of [Await]. Indeed, the [Await] can cause the
     domain to wait (see [Condition.wait] & [run]) but we must make sure that
     these [Await] are right (and not wait for an impossible situation). Before
     adding the suspension of our tasks, we check if it respects our rules.

     The illegal case corresponds when a promise is passed from one domain to
     another and the latter "waits" for the said promise. The relationship
     (parent <-> children) does not exist, we should fail with [Not_a_child].
     However, it can happen that the domain reaches the [Condition.wait] point
     **before** having done the illegal "await" - in this case, and if it has
     nothing to do, the domain will do the [Condition. wait] thinking there is a
     pending task in another domain (although it may have already completed).

     XXX(dinosaure): This case is still relevant (and, currently, it is rather
     healthy to do this post-cleaning) but the [Condition.wait] of a domain
     poses other concerns (starvation). We preferred the simple idea that a
     domain could continue to work (and sometimes even go into a burning loop)
     than to deal with the subtleties of a [Condition.wait] that would block the
     whole program. *)

             Indeed, stricto-sensus, we should still consume our "quantas" even
